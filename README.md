# EscroZone

**EscroZone** is a secure, decentralized escrow smart contract built using the Clarity language on the Stacks blockchain. It facilitates trusted transactions between buyers and sellers by holding funds in escrow until the transaction is either completed, canceled, or disputed. The smart contract integrates an arbiter to resolve disputes, ensuring fairness and security in the transaction process.

## Features

- **Secure Escrow:** Funds are held in escrow until the buyer and seller fulfill the transaction terms.
- **Arbiter System:** A third party (arbiter) is involved to settle disputes.
- **SIP-010 Token Integration:** Compatible with fungible tokens via the SIP-010 trait.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Either the buyer or seller can dispute a deal, triggering arbiter involvement.
- **Automated Payment Flows:** Funds are automatically transferred to the seller or refunded upon completion or cancellation of a deal.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using EscroZone, you need the following:

- Stacks Blockchain environment (you can set this up using the [Clarinet tool](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet)).
- Familiarity with Clarity, the smart contract language for the Stacks blockchain.
- A SIP-010 compliant fungible token contract to use as a currency for transactions (e.g., Stacks tokens or any other fungible tokens on the Stacks blockchain).

## Contract Architecture

### Error Codes

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED (u100)` | User is not authorized to perform the action. |
| `ERR-ALREADY-EXISTS (u101)` | The deal already exists. |
| `ERR-DOESNT-EXIST (u102)` | The specified deal does not exist. |
| `ERR-WRONG-STATUS (u103)` | The deal status is incorrect for the attempted action. |
| `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-FUNDS (u104)` | Insufficient funds for the transaction. |

### Deal Status

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `STATUS-ACTIVE (u1)` | The deal is active and ongoing. |
| `STATUS-COMPLETED (u2)` | The deal has been successfully completed. |
| `STATUS-CANCELLED (u3)` | The deal was canceled before completion. |
| `STATUS-DISPUTED (u4)` | The deal is in dispute and awaiting resolution. |

## Contract Functions

### Read-Only Functions

1. **`(get-deal (deal-id uint))`**
   - Fetches the details of a specific deal by its ID.
   - Returns a response containing the deal details, if found.

2. **`(get-next-deal-id)`**
   - Retrieves the next deal ID by querying the internal counter.

### Public Functions

1. **`(create-deal (buyer principal) (arbiter principal) (amount uint) (description (string-ascii 256)) (token-contract <sip-010-trait>))`**
   - Creates a new deal, specifying the buyer, arbiter, amount, and description.
   - Transfers tokens from the buyer to the escrow contract.

2. **`(complete-deal (deal-id uint) (token-contract <sip-010-trait>))`**
   - Marks a deal as complete and transfers funds from the escrow contract to the seller.

3. **`(cancel-deal (deal-id uint) (token-contract <sip-010-trait>))`**
   - Cancels an active deal, transferring the funds back to the seller.

4. **`(dispute-deal (deal-id uint))`**
   - Flags a deal as disputed by either the buyer or seller. The deal's status is updated, awaiting arbiter resolution.

## Usage

### Deploying the Contract

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miracleifuku/escrozone
   cd escrozone
   ```

2. **Install Clarinet** (if you haven't):
   ```bash
   cargo install clarinet
   ```

3. **Compile and deploy the contract**:
   ```bash
   clarinet check
   clarinet console
   ```

4. **Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain**:
   - Use the testnet or mainnet deployment tools available in Clarinet or the Stacks Explorer.

### Interacting with the Contract

You can interact with the contract through Clarinet's REPL environment or a Stacks wallet interface.

- **Creating a Deal**:
  ```clarity
  (create-deal buyer principal arbiter principal amount uint description "Deal description" token-contract)
  ```

- **Completing a Deal**:
  ```clarity
  (complete-deal deal-id uint token-contract)
  ```

- **Canceling a Deal**:
  ```clarity
  (cancel-deal deal-id uint token-contract)
  ```

- **Disputing a Deal**:
  ```clarity
  (dispute-deal deal-id uint)
  ```

---

## Security Considerations

- **Authorization**: Only the buyer, seller, or arbiter are allowed to modify the dealâ€™s status. Attempts to perform unauthorized actions will result in an error.
- **Funds Transfer**: Funds are transferred using the SIP-010 compliant token standard, ensuring compatibility and security.
- **Dispute Handling**: Disputes can only be triggered by either the buyer or seller, ensuring that the arbiter is involved only when necessary.

---

## Future Improvements

Some potential future improvements to the EscroZone contract include:

- **Multi-signature Escrow**: Allow multiple arbiters to reach a consensus before a dispute can be resolved.
- **Partial Payments**: Support for partial payments, where a percentage of the deal amount can be released at different milestones.
- **Enhanced Arbiter Role**: Implement a voting system for community-based arbitration.
